# Stanley Cup Craze - A Product Case Study

Our project aims to provide strategic marketing recommendations for Stanley tumblers by analyzing search trends, regional popularity, social media impact, and color preferences. 
As marketing consultants, we will identify peak search periods and regions with high interest, determine if social media has impacted searches for this product, and identify the most 
popular colors based on consumer ratings and reviews.

This data analysis project delves into the fascinating world of Stanley tumblers and their rising popularity influenced by social media trends. By harnessing the power of Google Trends and scrutinizing relevant articles to construct a timeline, this study examines how viral moments have spiked consumer interest in these products, as evidenced through crafted line graphs and histograms pinpointing these pivotal events.

Furthermore, the research explores geographical preferences within the United States using Google Trends data to compare searches for Stanley tumblers against competitors like Yeti and Hydro Flask. Visual representations include informative pie charts and maps showcase regional favoratism and regional outliers across the US.
