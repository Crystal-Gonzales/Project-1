"Reviewed in the United States on September 1, 2023",Tiffany C.,yes,yes,Not worth it,"Spend your money on something else. For $60, this sweats, spills, scratches easily, and does not keep water cold for long enough. I didn‚Äôt want to buy into the Stanley fad but this was the only bottle of this capacity that had a handle (small hands) and allowed me to use my own preferred straw. If you don‚Äôt fill it to the brim with ice, your water will be warm within a few hours. If you do fill it to the brim with ice, you will get about six hours of cold water (at least in air conditioning ‚Äì outside in the heat, forget about it) and all the ice makes it very heavy to carry around. I‚Äôve never had an insulated bottle that was this poor at keeping water cold, I think it‚Äôs too thin and needs an additional wall to trap the temperature. Lastly, I‚Äôve never had an insulated anything that sweats! Is that not the point of these things!? When I let the bottle sit in a room of about 75 degrees I can expect to come back and find it in a puddle. Ridiculous!",1,-,-,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R14KYW56YFKCVM/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BS1T7R8C,B0C7SD173Y,Style: 64 oz | Color: Black Glow
"Reviewed in the United States on September 16, 2023",Skyelander,yes,yes,I wanna get water wasted!,"Okay‚Ä¶. I don‚Äôt really want to get water wasted but I did buy this to increase my water intake. It sure helps to have this as I have noticed I am drinking more now than I had before. I really like the Stanley that I picked out. (30 oz size) It holds the temperature of my ice cold water even when I leave it in the car for hours on 90+ degree days. I am impressed by that for sure! I will say that I wish this was one of those bottles that I could throw in my bag but it is not. It will likely leak if it is on its side and guaranteed leak if it is upside down. Not a huge deal for me but something to mention. I do like that it has a handle so I can easily carry it around with all of my other endless amounts of junk. It is also easy to clean out with my scrub daddy sponge. Sometimes I throw it in the wash too although I‚Äôve heard mixed reviews about that. So far, no issues here.

I also add plenty of ice and it melts within an hour. It is does not keep liquids cold for anywhere near advertised. The other annoying thing is that it has a handle, which is theory, is nice, but not when your top need to be twisted on and you can't line up the drinking hole with the handle.
