"Reviewed in the United States on August 29, 2024",Moira Holloway,yes,-,Por ese precio esperaba algo que no filtrara,Sinceramente pensé que sería más resistente a fugas de líquido.

Al final siempre hay que estar asegurándote de llevarlo en algún posavasos para evitar que se incline y se derrame. Al menos mantiene el frío y el hielo por bastantes horas,3,-,-,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RVWM8ZTETVG8/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CRMP3RQT,B0CP9Y94YH,Size: 20 oz | Color: Rose Quartz 2.0
