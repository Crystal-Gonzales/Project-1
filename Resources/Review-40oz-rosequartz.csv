"Reviewed in the United States on June 18, 2024",MarilynneMarilynne,yes,yes,A Pretty Cup,"OK! I buckled and finally purchased a Stanley Cup. I’m normally purchase Yeti cups, but I heard so many raven reviews about the Stanley Cup until I decide to go ahead and get one.Needless to say, I prefer the Yeti cup in comparison to the Stanley Cup. The Stanley Cup is fashionable, pretty, looks nice with different outfits however, it leaks, scratches and dents easily, and the handle starts to wiggle after about three weeks of use.Being a teacher, I try to make sure I drink at least 64 ounces of water a day so this particular 40 ounce cup helped me to be able to drink that amount of water and some throughout the day while teaching. However, I was disappointed to see that when a student happened to knock it down on the floor it actually scratched off the paint and dented. I also noticed After roughly one month, the ice occasionally stayed frozen 11 hours and on some days, the ice melted in two to three hours inside an air condition building. So I’m not quite sure as to why on some days it would stay cold and on other days it would not. But the inconsistency is noted.Overtime the handle seems to be coming loose and when caring it in a Stanley designer carrying bag, the liquid in the cup actually leaks out of the top while hanging right side up off your shoulder. So the cup is not leak proof and will get the side of your clothes wet while you’re carrying it on your shoulder. Therefore, that is why I am rating this cup at a level three and not at least at level four.Now, for those who are die hard, Stanley Cup collectors don’t not purchase your Stanley Cup just based off of this review. However, if you are person like me who really needs a cup to do what it is advertised to do then this may not be the purchase you’re looking for.",3,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61XxbQOH3IL.jpg,-,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1XZ8T7AEHKNR3/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CRMP3RQT,B0CP9Z56SW,Size: 40 oz | Color: Rose Quartz 2.0
"Reviewed in the United States on June 18, 2024",Tim and StaceyTim and Stacey,yes,yes,Poor customer service,"We purchased this item as a Mother’s Day gift and it arrived in Amazon packaging bag And not a box as others have mentioned. It was supposed to be a new product and not used however is far from this. We attempted to reach out to the customer service email through the Stanley store that we purchased it from which appeared to be authentic however, the email kept bouncing. We then went to the Stanley tools websites was noted to be the official website listed for the story and it was The Stanley tools company website and not the correct Stanley 1913. We finally got ahold of the correct store and heard from the customer service. They informed us that we need to return it now to the place we purchased the item however we are now outside the return policy.
