"Reviewed in the United States on August 14, 2024",Sarah C.,yes,yes,Leaks ?,"I got this in the hopes that if you take the straw out, you could be able to turn the top thingy to make it close completely. In fact, even if you close the top sippy hole, it leaks like crazy if you tip it or flip it over. Not for me! will have to get something with a flip up straw or screw on cap. i dont understand what the point of having a waterbottle that MUST remain upright is, seems like a design oversight.",1,-,-,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1IBLFIYDX7ZXR/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CRMP3RQT,B0CPZYJDBQ,Size: 64 oz | Color: Black 2.0
"Reviewed in the United States on September 1, 2024",KuroodoD,yes,yes,Useless If Lid Can't Be Removed,"The lid tends to get stuck tight for whatever reason. No matter how much force I use, no matter what I try, it just doesn't want to come off sometimes. I have to leave it and go back to it later and try again. I'm very thirsty the morning of this review and want to prepare my drink. Unfortunately, I will have to be left with a massive paperweight because the lid doesn't want to come off, so I can't really practically pour anything in there let alone clean off the previous drink. Plain water straight from the gallon is always healthier anyway...",1,-,-,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3CNE507VRL1OA/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CRMP3RQT,B0CPZYJDBQ,Size: 64 oz | Color: Black 2.0
"Reviewed in the United States on August 24, 2024",Ali Najem SwarAli Najem Swar,yes,-,I received mine slightly damaged,"The product quality is great, but sadly I received mine damaged. I would expect if I’m buying something for $60.00 it would be packaged well for shipping, but apart from a paper wrap and a plastic bag, I feel that the product was not given proper care to begin with. I still stick by the products quality and think that it has a premium feel to it. But if you’re considering having it shipped, I would advise not to, you’re better off with something that is packaged well for shipping.",2,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61UgWYiRw1L.jpg,-,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1PBBPRLP6Z00R/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CRMP3RQT,B0CPZYJDBQ,Size: 64 oz | Color: Black 2.0

"Reviewed in the United States on August 30, 2024",Michael A Scott,yes,-,Leaks,"It cannot lay on its side, it will leak where the straw insert it.
