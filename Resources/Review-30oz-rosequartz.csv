"Reviewed in the United States on July 30, 2024",Meow Mama,yes,yes,"Yes, it’s worth it!","I have wanted a Stanley for a while but thought it was just more of a trend than anything else so I have hesitated spending the money on it. I finally decided to treat myself and see what all the hype was about. Oh wow, I get it now! This tumbler is amazing! I love it so much! I did a test where I put crushed ice, not cubed, filled it only halfway with ice and then the water. I timed how long the ice lasted and it was almost 40 hours later and the ice was finally gone! I swear this tumbler is the only way I can drink plain water, as it just tastes better in my Stanley. Maybe it’s a psychological thing but it’s worth it to me. I haven’t had issues with leaking, I use the straw through the straw holder part. The handle is perfect for my small hands, and it has the nice smooth grip. It’s easy to hold and it fits perfectly in my cup holders! I’m so glad I got this tumbler! Trust me, it’s worth the price! I also was pleased to see it was delivered wrapped in plastic and paper and arrived in perfect condition. If you’re on the fence about getting a Stanley tumbler like I was, just get it! It’s 100% worth it!",5,-,-,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1C9U6VBQ2KJBU/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CRMP3RQT,B0CP9YB3Q4,Size: 30 oz | Color: Rose Quartz 2.0

"Reviewed in the United States on July 30, 2024",T CavazosT Cavazos,yes,yes,Not my favorite Stanley,"This isn’t my favorite Stanley but I know it’s the most popular. I need something that won’t spill and even when you twist the straw lid to close, it still drips out which I don’t love. I’m usually very careful but I want the peace of mind that if it does tip over, I won’t have a huge mess to clean up. Don’t get me wrong, I understand the hype and it’s cute but it’s not as practical as I’d like it to be. I do like that the handle is better IMO over the Yeti. It’s not as bulky and the insulation keeps the drink about as cold as Yetis.",4,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71fOh672SEL.jpg,-,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R7VMSDMVTY2WS/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CRMP3RQT,B0CP9YB3Q4,Size: 30 oz | Color: Rose Quartz 2.0

If you enjoy pinks and neutral tones, this will be a nice addition to your collection. Definitely a must-have for anyone that likes to match their cup to their outfit and this color being soo popular now. I love that these cups can go in the dishwasher, bc handwashing just isn’t it. Keeps my drinks icy cold days. So many cute, versatile accessories available. Amazon has a better price on these than the Stanley1913 site, along with major other competitors. The cup itself is very durable and heavy duty, but not heavy. I pair a bent 30-40oz white or pink silicone straw with my cups. I had a friend that cracked a tooth drinking from a metal straw while driving. You always want to give your kids silicone straws, too. The 30oz capacity is perfect for anyone going all-day and should see you through your work day. While I have a 40oz, I feel like the 30 is less bulky and takes up less room in my car and in my workspace. Don’t get me wrong tho, I love my 40s, too!!
