I Drink at least 2 of these 40 Oz Stanley quenchers a day. It keeps liquid cold. Bye bye lukewarm water. Ice cold water all day. The Handle makes it so easy to hold. Sounds silly but believe me, its a thing. The bottom of the travel cup is smaller and it fits right in your cup holder!!! Genius!!! That was always an issue. It has not leaked at all. So many colors to choose from. I get so many compliments and inquiries. Now it is a bit pricey but it’s the only one you will need. Worth it l.

"Reviewed in the United States on November 21, 2022",HomeShopper,yes,yes,"easy to clean, fits in cup holder","This water bottle is my new go to. I loved my hydroflask, but it never fit in my cup holder. I also liked the starbucks cups but they don’t hold enough water. This water bottle holds a lot of water, keeps ice cold, and fits in the cup holder. I saw some reviews saying it leaked, but I dropped mine off the table with the straw in and nothing spilled in the time it took me to grab it. No, you can’t put it in a bag with the straw and not expect leaks but this is good enough for me. It also is super easy to clean. I love it. I have weak wrists and the handle makes it easy to hold and carry. I will probably have this for 50 years - worth the money.",5,-,-,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3NUV56IBT4UP2/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BD76BTSN,B0BD76BTSN,Color: Cream 2.0 | Size: 1 Count (Pack of 1)
