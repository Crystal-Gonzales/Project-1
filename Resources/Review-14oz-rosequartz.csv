"Reviewed in the United States on May 23, 2024",JeanineJeanine,yes,yes,I would have rated it 0 if could,"I spent 54 USD to send it to Italy, (taxes and shipping incl.) because I liked the brand mainly for the life warranty. I was expecting at least a bare minimum protection, but they just put the product inside the Amazon package which was neither the box, so it has arrived in Italy damaged and DIRTY. I am very disappointed, also because I had to pay extra, and this is what I received. At least other costumers had an extra plastic bag. I did have nothing.",1,"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61l4ONO72hL.jpg , https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71vO1eegnvL.jpg , https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71yzuQX4r7L.jpg",-,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R9Z41CPTHD6MN/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CRMP3RQT,B0CP9WRDFV,Size: 14 oz | Color: Rose Quartz 2.0

"Reviewed in the United States on August 31, 2024",Halimatou GassamaHalimatou Gassama,yes,yes,14oz,"I got the 14 ounce Stanley because the other Stanley seemed really big. It doesnâ€™t have a handle which I was expecting however, when I got it it got delayed by a couple days initially was supposed to come on 28 August however it ended up arriving on the 31st. I didnâ€™t really have a problem with this as I didnâ€™t need that early. However, when it came, it did have a couple of scratches on it. It had a couple scratches but not any dents Overall, I really love it",3,"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61UVxwdlt0L.jpg , https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61cJhq0h0hL.jpg , https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61xmjV6vxtL.jpg",-,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RQ9O5OKUO66DM/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CRMP3RQT,B0CP9WRDFV,Size: 14 oz | Color: Rose Quartz 2.0
"Reviewed in the United States on August 21, 2024",Anoynomous,yes,yes,Keeps water cold for hours,"This is currently one of my favorite 16 oz cups I'm drinking out of daily, its easy to wash, and the performance and insulation of this cup is top knotch quality. On a scorching hot day with heatwaves on a summer day. Luckily my water stayed cold for hours. Unfortunately I did not have the luxury of  air conditioning  so this cup helped keep me cool and hydrated after I thawed it from the freezer. I most recently saw an advertising from Stanley cup on Instagram seeking to find scouts to help promote their Stanley cup and I would absolutely love to team up with Amazon and or Stanley to help promote some of thier things. I would love even some freebies to promote. Although there are plenty of knock off Stanley cups  everywhere, in my personal opinion I have to say the Stanley brand name cup was worth the price!",5,-,-,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1K0XQINESYYPI/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CRMP3RQT,B0CP9WRDFV,Size: 14 oz | Color: Rose Quartz 2.0
"Reviewed in the United States on July 7, 2024",Natalie HumphriesNatalie Humphries,yes,-,Cute butâ€¦..,"Mine came damaged. Will be going through Stanley directly as I donâ€™t have a UPS store close by. A little disappointed. I was so excited for my little one to have one just like me, but for $20 a cup I would rather her damage it herself then it come that way. I just feel like whoever packaged my items would have definitely seen this before letting it be shipped to a paying customer this way. I personally love my Stanley. Aside from the leaking when itâ€™s knocked over I love it. Itâ€™s  Easy to clean itâ€™s easy to hold by the handle. Fits in any cup holder as well.",3,"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61bh4FJcNGL.jpg , https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61bsKV5x2SL.jpg",-,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RVRH8U770JBHZ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CRMP3RQT,B0CP9WRDFV,Size: 14 oz | Color: Rose Quartz 2.0

"Reviewed in the United States on August 27, 2024",JzHolmes,yes,-,Ok Product,"I recently bought the Stanley Quencher H2.0 FlowState Tumbler, and while I love the design and insulation, I have to give it 3 stars because it leaks. The stainless steel construction and the included lid and straw are great, and it keeps drinks hot or cold as promised. However, the leaking issue is a significant drawback and makes it less practical for everyday use. If youâ€™re looking for a tumbler with reliable leak-proof performance, you might want to consider other options.",3,-,-,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1U8SJIZQFBDZR/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CRMP3RQT,B0CP9WRDFV,Size: 14 oz | Color: Rose Quartz 2.0
