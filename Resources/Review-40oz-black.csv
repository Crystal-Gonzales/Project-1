"Reviewed in the United States on June 20, 2024",AnonAnon,yes,yes,Handle broke,"After a day at the beach I went to place my hammock in my sisters Toyota Camry (not a high car), and forgot my two Stanly products on the roof by the passenger door. When my sister pulled out of the parking spot going maybe 5 miles per hours the Stanlys tumbled off the roof and we heard them clatter against the floor. My sister put the vehicle in park and when I got out the car to recover the Stanly products the handle of my cup was ripped cleared off. The other Stanly product survived the 4ft 8inch fall but is extremely dented.

"Reviewed in the United States on August 10, 2024",Alyssa WhiteAlyssa White,yes,-,Broke after 3 months,I am not hard on my products whatsoever and to have my Stanley cup break after only 3 months of use is ridiculous.
