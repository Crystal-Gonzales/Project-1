"Reviewed in the United States on July 3, 2023",Rosy MonarrezRosy Monarrez,yes,yes,2nd Time I Order 💗,"2nd time I order the same Stanley from this vendor. I reordered because I was so upset I accidentally forgot my first Stanley outside on the bench of my son’s barbershop a month ago before leaving on vacation because I was rushing getting last minute things done. Cup has no damages to it and it arrived 3 days earlier than expected. I’m excited to have my cup back!!! 😃P.S My husband and 2 kids also have Stanley cups for daily use, they bring it to the table every time we sit down to eat, and every time we go out. Helps eliminate half dranked water bottles around the house. Each picked their own color for easy identification.",5,"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71ad755QnWL.jpg , https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71oclr35c5L.jpg , https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71ymaSZvTGL.jpg",-,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RHH11IZ7ZAHQT/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BD6XRYK8,-,-
"Reviewed in the United States on October 4, 2022",Lisa TuckerLisa Tucker,yes,yes,Stanley is awesome,"The best part about the Stanley mug is the name. Stanley has always been synonymous with ""thermos"". Men and women oftern carried their hot soup or coffee to work and it would still be hot at the end of the day. The same confidence is available with the mug. I am not great at getting my daily water quota in. The water sits too long. The ice melts and I am left with tepid water. With this mug, the water is still cold and ice left in the mug 24 hours later. It's amazing. I use it when going on a trip so that I have a nice cold beverage for the entire time.The only negatives are 1. The price. It's a big hefty for 1 mug.2. It can be a bit heavy because of the metal necessary to keep the liquid cold. If you have any arthritis or wrist issues, you may find a smaller version a better fit.Overall, I am extremely happy with the purchase.",5,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61ln60Tm6AL.jpg,-,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2203QV595ZNQJ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BD6XRYK8,-,-

It is a very pretty shade of light pink, and seems very sturdy and keeps her ice water cold for a long time. However, for those seriously debating getting this cup, it is HUGE and barely fits in standard cup holders. It does not fit in the side pockets of most backpacks. And it is HEAVY - way heavier than any of the Yetis, Swigs and Corkcicles we own. And it is DEFINITELY not leakproof!!  I’m not sure how you can advertise it as such when it had a straw. My daughter set hers on her bed one time and it fell over and all 40oz of water spilled very quickly onto her bed.
