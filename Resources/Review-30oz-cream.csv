 Hyped for a reason","For over a year I‚Äôve contemplated buying a stanley cup. finally, i caved in and i understand now, this cup works so good. my ice stays for up to 12 hours and when it melts it stays cold for 24+ hours. I will say, yes it leaks only when strongly tilted which is rare, and really not much comes out and it‚Äôs just water. The 30oz was a great pick for me, it‚Äôs lots of water but easy to carry around and fits in all cup holders. The straw is very durable as well as the rest of the cup and it‚Äôs super easy to clean both hand washing and dishwasher",,https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-locale/common/grey-pixel.gif,"Reviewed in the United States on September 3, 2024",0,Verified Purchase,Size: 30 ozColor: Cream 2.0

 Perfect","My daughter wanted to jump on the Stanley trend. She had researched other brands, but in the end went with Stanley. She also searched on box store website and found this exact one in stock. When we went to pick it up, they didn't have it this color actually in stock. She was extremely disappointed. After looking online for this color, we finally checked amazon, ordered it, and had it the next day! Shipping was fast and she loves how her ice stays cold now rather than melting quickly.

 Cracking/Chipping after less than 6 months of use","This worked great for a while. We just bring it from the kitchen to the home office and back to be washed. Along the way this one started cracking/chipping already. I pinged Stanley about a warranty claim and their unfortunate response is below. I've had swag mugs from company events that chip/peel like this after a few months but was expecting more from Stanley. My Yeti is still holding together great after a couple of years. I'll stick to Yeti going forward as apparently this damage is considered normal.

 Not too big or too small","Bought this for my daughter. She didn't want the huge 40 oz for obvious reasons, to us. They seem so big too carry around. I know they work for a lot of people.

She wasn't a huge water drinker and if this helps her drink more, it is well worth the cost!! Looks good, too.

 I absolutely love my Stanley","The Stanley Quencher H2.0 FlowState Tumbler has quickly become my go-to for staying hydrated throughout the day.My drinks stay cold for hourrs, I've even left ice water in it overnight, and there were still ice cubes the next morning! It also does an excellent job keeping my coffee hot for several hours, making it perfect for busy mornings.
This tumbler is built to last. The stainless steel construction feels sturdy and durable, yet it‚Äôs surprisingly lightweight. The lid fits securely, and I appreciate the rotating cover that keeps the straw clean when I‚Äôm on the go. The design is sleek and modern, and the range of colors available makes it easy to find one that suits your style.
The wide mouth makes it easy to add ice cubes and also to clean. The FlowState straw is a nice touch‚Äîit has a comfortable size for sipping, and I love that it‚Äôs reusable. The tumbler fits perfectly in my car‚Äôs cup holder, which is a big plus for me since I‚Äôm always on the move.
The Stanley Quencher H2.0 Tumbler is a fantastic investment if you‚Äôre looking for a high-quality, versatile tumbler that performs well for both hot and cold beverages. It's stylish, practical, and worth every penny. Highly recommended!","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71DFiuV8v1L.88.jpg
